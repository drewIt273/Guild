# Guild Programming Language

Guild is an experimental programming language and ecosystem designed to simplify application and interface development while remaining close to system-level performance and control.

The project explores how a modern language can bridge the gap between low-level power (C/C++, Rust) and high-level developer ergonomics, with a strong focus on structure, clarity, and tooling.

> This project is currently in early development and under active design.

## 🎯 Vision

Guild aims to provide:
- A clean and expressive syntax
- Strong separation of concerns (logic, interface, styling)
- A modern compilation and tooling pipeline
- An ecosystem designed for scalability and long-term evolution

Rather than replacing existing languages, Guild is intended to **work alongside them**, especially for building user interfaces and structured applications.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- **Declarative UI & structure** through a dedicated markup system
- **Explicit file roles** (script, markup, stylesheet, etc.)
- **Compiler-driven tooling** (documentation, validation, optimization)
- **Interoperability** with lower-level languages via FFI
- **Modular architecture** for future extensibility

---

## 🧩 Components (Planned / In Progress)

- Compiler
- Runtime Engine
- Standard Library
- Markup Language (GML)
- Tooling (CLI, Docs Generator)
- IDE / Editor Integration

Not all components are implemented yet. Some exist only as design drafts or prototypes.

## 📁 Project Status

This repository currently contains:
- Design documents and notes

Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and frequent refactoring.

---

## 🚧 Development Philosophy

- Clarity over cleverness
- Structure over shortcuts
- Long-term design over short-term convenience

Guild is developed as a **learning-driven, research-oriented project**, with an emphasis on understanding systems, compilers, and language design deeply.
